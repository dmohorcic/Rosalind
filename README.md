# Rosalind

This repository includes my solutions for [ROSALIND](https://rosalind.info/).

## Reproducibility

This repository uses library biopython.

## Structure

The code is sorted in folders by problem topics. The code for each problem is in file `<id>.py`. The input for each problem must be placed in the same folder and named `rosalind_<id>.txt` (default ROSALIND file name). The code must be run from the root folder. The output of each program can be directly copy-pasted into ROSALIND answer submission input box.
